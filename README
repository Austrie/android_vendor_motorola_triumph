This repo hosts the proprietary files for the Motorola Triumph so you don't have
to pull them from your phone.

After doing a repo sync, please run the extract-files.sh script to copy the files
to the final location in your build environment.

type:

cd <your working directory>/device/motorola/triumph
sh ./extract-files.sh
